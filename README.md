## üìú Available Scripts

### 1. **XP Tracker**
Tracks how much experience you're gaining per minute and estimates time remaining until your next level in the currently active skill. Perfect for grinders and optimizers.

### 2. **Auto Banking**
Once activated while viewing your bank, this script will automatically deposit all items that:
- Do **not** provide Luck bonuses
- Do **not** have Defensive or Offensive stats
- Do **not** have any level requirements

Extremely useful for auto-clearing junk items like **Masked Hoods** from dungeon runs.

### 3. **Auto Dungeon**
Automatically re-enters dungeons after death. Great for consistent farming in harder areas like **Lostmere's Cemetery**, improving EXP per hour with minimal downtime.

### 4. **Auto Location**
Allows you to automatically travel to a selected location from a dropdown list.  
Perfect for long runs, travel loops, or just saving clicks while farming across regions.

### 5. **All-in-One Toolkit Script**
A compiled version that includes **XP Tracker**, **Auto Banking**, **Auto Dungeon**, and **Auto Location** in a **single unified script**.  
Great for players who want to run everything at once with minimal setup.
